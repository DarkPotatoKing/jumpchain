DarkPotatoKing's Jumpchain Run

I lost my previous Jumpchain progress and I'm too lazy to backtrack my adventures, so I'm gonna start a new jump and put my progress here so it won't get lost

[What is a jumpchain?](https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/)

I've decided that for now I'll skip the Warehouse, Body Mod, and Companion house supplements. For my next runs, I'll just assume that I have them but I won't deal much with the details

# Jumps (In chronological order)
- [Pokemon](https://github.com/DarkPotatoKing/jumpchain#pokemon)
- [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://github.com/DarkPotatoKing/jumpchain#fullmetal-alchemist)
- [Teen Titans] (https://github.com/DarkPotatoKing/jumpchain/#teen-titans)

(Note: The jump histories below is listed from newest to oldest)

# [Teen Titans](http://imgur.com/a/VHMOb)

Age: 14 (rolled)

Gender: Male

Species: Tamaranean (800) - It gives a pretty good set of powers for only 800 cp.

History:  Athlete (100) - I want to get the discount for Super Speed.

Location: Jump City

Powers:
- Starbolts - From now on this will be my main form of offense when I have to do massive damage.
- Flight - I finally have a flight ability that allows me to fly up to the speed of sound, cool.
- Superhuman Condition - Lifting up to 25 tons is nice, plus the all around stat improvement is great.
- Omnilinguistic Assimilation - Might be useful some time.
- Self-sustenance - As a humonculus I already pretty self-sustaining, but if I can't survive outer space  naked before then I definitely can now.
- Environmental adaptation - More durability is never a bad thing.
- Empathy (100) - Pretty useful ability for only 100 cp, for example I can sense when there is hostility nearby.
- Super Speed (200) - Now I can also run at Mach 1, combine this with my Mach 1 flight plus the ability to process things even when going really fast then that gives me a nice combination of speed, agility, and control.
- Teleportation (300) - I can create portals as well, this allows me to travel long distances without having to use my speed.

Drawbacks:
- Coveted (+200) - I can sense emotions and I can shapeshift because of my homunculus background. I'm also fast so it'll be to catch me if they find me. Worse comes to worst I can do some overpowered alchemy using my Philosopher's Stone to escape or kill whatever is after me.
- Overheating (+300) - I'm an alchemist, converting the built up energy in my body into something more safe is trivial. So really this "Drawback" is more like a perk since I get more stored energy that is usable in a lot of way.

I'll spend my 10 years just doing hero stuff. I'm not gonna go with the Teen Titans since I'm a lot more powerful than them and having me on their battles might change the outcome of the story drastically (for bettter or for worse). Though I think it's inevitable that we will interact and even help each other at some point. I'll just be friends with them and maybe visit the tower from time to time but I'll be doing my hero stuff mostly solo.

[Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/4lny4k/fullmetal_alchemist_jumpchain/d90413r)

Location: Ishval (choosen, 100)

Age: 19 (rolled, 3+2+14)

Gender: Male

Background: Drop-In - This one is the best choice for me because of the Complications I'll take.

Abilities:
- Advanced Formulae (100) - I need this knowledge to headstart my quest for knowledge.
- Humonculus: Envy (800) - His shapeshifting skills is essential for this jump. Shapeshifting is also a pretty versatile abilty. Weighing a ton means I'm as heavy as around 15 humans, so my punch would be able to deal a lot of force. Combine my weight with the natural strength and speed of a homunculus and that's pretty scary. Of course, my favorite part of being a humonculus is the durability, regeneration, and the ability to survive without food or sleep. These skills would be very useful in future runs since I'm pretty much self-sustaining when left alone.

Items:
- Red Stone (600) - Spoiler, this is actually an actual Philosopher's stone. Aside from the stone I also get knowledge on how to make the stone, though I'd rather not. With Advanced Formulae I would be able to perform powerful Alchemy even without the need of transmutation circles. Also, a backup stone in case I use up too much of my regeneration.

Complications:
- Tremor (+300) - Compensated since I have a stone so I don't have to draw circles to perform Alchemy. I can also fare well in combat even without Alchemy.
- Enemy of the State (+300) - Compensated since I'm a Drop-in which means they have no previous records  of me. I also have a shapeshifting ability so it'll be really hard for the Military to track me. Since the only one after me is just the Military itself and not  the people behind the Military, I can probably fight them effortlessly aside from a few State Alchemist like Mustang.

I'm hunted by the Military so what I'll do is constantly shapeshift between forms in order to elude them. I'll be starting at Ishval, but I have nothing to do there and I don't care about the people, so instead I'll travel immediately to Central. What I'll be doing here is to learn more about Alchemy while also having fun. I'll try out all the food in Amestris. I don't care about people so I'll rob and maybe kill some rich people in order to get money to spend on, or I can also steal whatever I want, whichever is more convenient. Of course I won't do it too much since I wouldn't want the Military to put their eyes too much on me.

Aside from having fun, I  also want to learn more about Alchemy. I'll do this by going to libraries and going to famous alchemists to study Alchemy, with the help of shapeshifting so that I can get into places by disguising as high ranking officials or State Alchemists. I have perfect memory from my Pokemon jump, so if I can read a book just once it'll be stored in my memory and I'll be able to use the knowledge there anytime, I think this would speed up my learning of Alchemy by quite a lot.

In terms of the story line, I'll stay away from it as much as possible. When the big event is about to happen, I'll move to Xing, then learn about Alkahestry and have fun similar to what I did in Amestris. I expect within 10 years I'll have several conflicts with the Military but nothing too much I can't handle. Thus, after 10 years I proceed to my next jump together with my Humonculus body, Philosopher stone, and a lot of knowledge about Alchemy and Alkahestry.


# [Pokemon](http://imgur.com/a/lp6Pp)

Location: Sinnoh (rolled)

Age: 10 (rolled) - nice I'm the same age as Ash haha

Gender: Male

Identity: City Life (50)

Starter: Charmander (free) - My favorite Gen I starter. <3 Also great when it evolves into a Charizard.

Skills:
- Freerunning (free) - Easy parkour skills.
- Physical Fitness (100) - Health is wealth, plus strength close to Captain America (for a 10 year old) seems nice.
- Psionics (300) - Telekinesis and Telepathy are useful skills all around and can help with the Flaws I'm taking.
- Savant (600) - Getting this mainly for the Perfect Memory, which will be useful even in future jumps.
- Survival Training (100) - I had an extra 100 cp so I decide to spend it here since it will be useful.

Items:
- Rebreather (50) - Breathing underwater and even in toxic water seems like a useful gear for a mere 50 cp.

Flaws:
- Cripled (+100) - I have telekinesis and acrobatic skills to compensate for this.
- Silenced (+100) - I have telepathy I can use to communicate with people and pokemon so this should be manageable.

I spend my 10 years here joining different Pokemon leagues, challenging Gyms, and training Pokemon. I don't aim for championships but I do my best to train my Pokemon. I catch a Ponyta which eventually evolves into a Rapidash which becomes my main mode of transportation on land. I catch a Wailmer and evolve it into a Wailord which becomes my main mode of transporatation on water (size matters, I can lie down comforably while Wailord ferries me along the water).

I catch a Machop which becomes a Machamp because it's nice to have a really buff guy around. I catch a Dratini and evolve it to a Dragonite which I ride on to fly (if I'm not using telekinesis to fly, though I don't know how comfortable riding a Dragonite would be). I catch an Abra and evolve it into Alakazam, I get to train Psionics with my Alakazam. Furthermore another psychic user and a teleporter would be very useful outside of battle.

Finally, I have my best friend Charmander who evolves into Charizard. I give a unique nickname to each of them. (OOC: I should decide what names they should have later on.) I go around and travel the world, meet new people, catch and train my Pokemon as well as my abilities.

At the end of ten years, I take the 6 Pokemon I mentioned above with me  to my next jump.
