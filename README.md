DarkPotatoKing's Jumpchain Run

I lost my previous Jumpchain progress and I'm too lazy to backtrack my adventures, so I'm gonna start a new jump and put my progress here so it won't get lost

[TODO: Explain Jumpchain rules]

Location: Sinnoh (rolled)

Age: 10 (rolled) - nice I'm the same age as Ash haha

Gender: Male

Identity: City Life (50)

Starter: Charmander (free) - My favorite Gen I starter. <3 Also great when it evolves into a Charizard.

Skills:
- Freerunning (free) - Easy parkour skills.
- Physical Fitness (100) - Health is wealth, plus strength close to Captain America (for a 10 year old) seems nice.
- Psionics (300) - Telekinesis and Telepathy are useful skills all around and can help with the Flaws I'm taking.
- Savant (600) - Getting this mainly for the Perfect Memory, which will be useful even in future jumps.
- Survival Training (100) - I had an extra 100 cp so I decide to spend it here since it will be useful.

Items:
- Rebreather (50) - Breathing underwater and even in toxic water seems like a useful gear for a mere 50 cp.

Flaws:
- Cripled (+100) - I have telekinesis and acrobatic skills to compensate for this.
- Silenced (+100) - I have telepathy I can use to communicate with people and pokemon so this should be manageable.

I spend my 10 years here joining different Pokemon leagues, challenging Gyms, and training Pokemon. I don't aim for championships but I do my best to train my Pokemon. I catch a Ponyta which eventually evolves into a Rapidash which becomes my main mode of transportation on land. I catch a Wailmer and evolve it into a Wailord which becomes my main mode of transporatation on water (size matters, I can lie down comforably while Wailord ferries me along the water).

I catch a Machop which becomes a Machamp because it's nice to have a really buff guy around. I catch a Dratini and evolve it to a Dragonite which I ride on to fly (if I'm not using telekinesis to fly, though I don't know how comfortable riding a Dragonite would be). I catch an Abra and evolve it into Alakazam, I get to train Psionics with my Alakazam. Furthermore another psychic user and a teleporter would be very useful outside of battle.

Finally, I have my best friend Charmander who evolves into Charizard. I give a unique nickname to each of them. (OOC: I should decide what names they should have later on.) I go around and travel the world, meet new people, catch and train my Pokemon as well as my abilities.

At the end of ten years, I take the 6 Pokemon I mentioned above with me  to my next jump.
