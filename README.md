DarkPotatoKing's Jumpchain Run

I lost my previous Jumpchain progress and I'm too lazy to backtrack my adventures, so I'm gonna start a new jump and put my progress here so it won't get lost

Location: Sinnoh (rolled)

Age: 10 (rolled) - nice I'm the same age as Ash haha

Gender: Male

Identity: City Life (50)

Starter: Charmander (free) - My favorite Gen I starter. <3 Also great when it evolves into a Charizard.

Skills:
- Freerunning (free) - Easy parkour skills.
- Physical Fitness (100) - Health is wealth, plus strength close to Captain America (for a 10 year old) seems nice.
- Psionics (300) - Telekinesis and Telepathy are useful skills all around and can help with the Flaws I'm taking.
- Savant (600) - Getting this mainly for the Perfect Memory, which will be useful even in future jumps.
- Survival Training (100) - I had an extra 100 cp so I decide to spend it here since it will be useful.

Items:
- Rebreather (50) - Breathing underwater and even in toxic water seems like a useful gear for a mere 50 cp.

Flaws:
- Cripled (+100) - I have telekinesis and acrobatic skills to compensate for this.
- Silenced (+100) - I have telepathy I can use to communicate with people and pokemon so this should be manageable.
